class ParticleTracker( object ):
    """
    Class that allows to select particles at a given iteration
    (by initializing an instance of this class) and then
    to return the same particles at another iteration (by passing
    this instance as the argument `select` of the method `get_particle`
    of an `OpenPMDTimeSeries`)

    Usage
    -----
    Here is a minimal example of how this class is used.
    In this example, all the particles in the simulation box at iteration 300
    are selected, and then the position of the same particles at iteration 400
    (or at least of those particles that remained in the simulation box at
    iteration 400) are returned.
    ```
    >>> ts = OpenPMDTimeSeries('./hdf5_directory/')
    >>> pt = ParticleTracker( ts, iteration=300 )
    >>> x, = ts.get_particle( ['x'], select=pt, iteration=400 )
    ```
    For more details on the API of ParticleTracker, see the docstring of
    the `__init__` method of this class.

    Note
    ----
    `ParticleTracker` requires the `id` of the particles
    to be stored in the openPMD files.

        """
        Initialize an instance of `ParticleTracker`: select particles at
        a given iteration, so that they can be retrieved at a later iteration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ts: an OpenPMDTimeSeries object
            Contains the data on the particles

        species: string
            A string indicating the name of the species
            This is optional if there is only one species

        t : float (in seconds), optional
            Time at which to obtain the data (if this does not correspond to
            an available file, the last file before `t` will be used)
            Either `t` or `iteration` should be given by the user.

        iteration : int
            The iteration at which to obtain the data
            Either `t` or `iteration` should be given by the user.

        select: dict, optional
            Either None or a dictionary of rules
            to select the particles, of the form
            'x' : [-4., 10.]  (Particles having x between -4 and 10 microns)
            'ux' : [-0.1, 0.1] (Particles having ux between -0.1 and 0.1 mc)
            'uz' : [5., None]  (Particles with uz above 5 mc)

        preserve_particle_index: bool, optional
            When retrieving particles at a several iterations,
            (for instance, with:
            ```
            >>> x1, = ts.get_particle( ['x'], select=pt, iteration=400 )
            >>> x2, = ts.get_particle( ['x'], select=pt, iteration=500 )
            ```
            it is sometimes important that the same individual particle has
            the same index in the array `x1` and `x2`.
            Using `preserve_particle_index=True` ensures that this is the case.
            However, this means that, for a particle that becomes absent at
            a later iteration, its index in the array has to be filled also.
            In this case, a NaN is returned at the index of this particle.
            When `preserve_particle_index=False`, no NaN is returned (the
            returned array is simply smaller when particles are absent) but
            then it is not garanteed that a given particle keeps the same index

        pid, so as to be able to retrieve the indices) and use the fact
        that it is sorted in order to rapidly extract the elements
